# StructProject

# Description

If you choose to code, you will write small code that displays the major difference between two 
languages in two different paradigms.

# Requirements/Commands
Requires c/c++ compiler
C:
```
c++ revWordStr.c -o reverse
./reverse
```
C++:
```
c++ revWordStr.cpp -o reverse
./reverse
```
# Explanation/Comparison

The main difference between these two applications of a program which reverses a given string by words is that the C program is limited to procedural programming as its main paradigm, meanwhile the C++ program is capable of utilizing both the procedural of its predecessor and the object-oriented programming it is known for. This is heavily shown in the C++ program whenever a function's operation is done on the data held in an object rather than data being sent through a function in the way of C.
